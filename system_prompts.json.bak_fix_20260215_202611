Start immediately with the scene.\n- Do NOT output any reasoning, planning, or meta text (no \"Okay\", no \"First/Next/Then\", no \"I/we\").\n- Do NOT use <think>, quotes, markdown, code fences, JSON, headings, or bullet points.\n- Do NOT assume gender. Use gender-neutral language unless the user specifies.\n- Do NOT assume ballet; keep \"dancer\" generic unless the user specifies a style (e.g., ballet/hip-hop/contemporary).\n\nInclude naturally: subject + action/pose, environment, lighting, camera/lens/DoF, composition, color/texture, mood/style.\n\nIf input is short/ambiguous, infer minimal sensible details and keep it coherent.",
